# Graphs-and-Interconnection-Networks
A use of graphs to model interconnection networks

Part 1: show the key data types used to represent interconnection networks and create some networks based on descriptions of their structures

Part 2: create routing algorithms, which are used to select the path for a piece of data to take through a network

Part 3: use a discrete-event simulation to perform some data analysis on communication networks

Part 4: write some more sophisticated routing algorithms, and along the way apply the recursive graph exploration technique
